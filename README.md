## Too immersed in the game to write a review.

**Chess Review** is a chess.com game review clone web application designed for chess enthusiasts who want detailed game analysis. It is built using **React** and **Stockfish**, with a focus on accuracy and performance.

### Features
- **Server-based Stockfish Analysis:** Currently, the app uses a server-side Stockfish evaluation for demo purposes.
- **Ongoing Development:** We are actively working on implementing a browser-based Stockfish evaluation for an improved and seamless user experience. Brilliant moves are yet to be implemented in v1.
- **Tailwind CSS for Styling:** Ensures a clean and responsive interface.
